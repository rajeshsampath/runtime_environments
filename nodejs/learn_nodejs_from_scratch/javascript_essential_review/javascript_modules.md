By the end of this lesson, weâ€™ll be able to apply ES6 modules to modularize our scripts.

Modules allow developers to organize their codebase within separate files or components for better reusability, flexibility, shareability, and overall maintenance.

Multiple modules can be composed together to create an application.

ECMAScript modules, which are a newer feature in JavaScript, are defined with the use of the import and export keywords.
