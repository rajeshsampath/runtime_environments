# Why Node.js

Node.js has gained popularity in the industry for the many service it provides. Many big companies, such as 
*** Netflix, Uber, Paypal, Microsoft and more ***, are using Node.js. It's a popular choice for building microservice-oriented architectures.

Node.js is light, scalable and fast. It uses a single-threaded non-blocking I/O model capable of processing multiple concurrent requests
using asynchronous request handling.

We'll be expanding on these concepts as the course continues.

Today, Node.js is supported by a large and active open-source community.

Node Package Manager(npm) is the largest software registry in the world, hosting more than one million free open-source packages.

Eleven million developers worldwide rely on npm's publicly available and reusable modules.

Some of the most valuable npm modules today include Express.js and Scoket.io, which we'll explore in this course.

> ### Why is Node.js awesome?
> - Node.js is light, scalable, & fast. As a result, it is quickly gaining popularity in the industry. There is a large, active open-source community supporting the ecosystem.
